// Two kinds of entry:
//   - by design: the phase is structurally impossible (an immutable resource
//     has no in-place update; a resource with no ImportState has no import).
//     These are permanent — the reason says "by design".
//   - debt: the phase IS supported but the test doesn't exercise it yet.
//     These must shrink: add the step, delete the entry.

// test does not exercise UPDATE and/or IMPORT. A new resource must ship both
// steps (or an immutable/no-import resource gets a "by design" entry here with
// the justification) — never add a plain debt entry to dodge the check.
